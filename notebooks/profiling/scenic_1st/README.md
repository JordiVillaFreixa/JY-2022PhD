In this info_1st.txt, you can find computational statistics regarding appyling the first step of SCENIC workflow to a dataset containing 3233 cells.

8 threads were used for this process and it consumed 10.4h hours of user CPU time. The peak memory usage by the process is 4.3 GB.

Context: I have been working on generating computational statistics regarding SCENIC workflow in order to provide references for RES application. Testing on datasets of 5k cells and 10k cells are the final steps.

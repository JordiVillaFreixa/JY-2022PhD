In documents(*.txt), you can find computational statistics regarding each step when appyling SCENIC workflow to a dataset containing 4021 cells. Notebooks used are uploaded as well.

**In summary, SCENIC took 14 hours to process this dataset and the the peak memory usage is 6.3GB.**

8 threads were used for the first step and it consumed 11 hours of user CPU time. The peak memory usage by the process is 5.5 GB.
9 threads were used for the second step and it consumed 2 hours, 22 minutes of user CPU time. The peak memory usage by the process is 6.3 GB.
10 threads were used for the third step and it consumed 18 minutes of user CPU time. The peak memory usage by the process is 4.4 GB.

Context: I have been working on generating computational statistics regarding SCENIC workflow in order to provide references for RES application. Testing on datasets of 5k cells and 10k cells are the final steps.
